# Runs the client under cdb (console debugger) so any crash is captured live
# with the full stack and locals — no need to wait for WER dumps.
#
# Usage:
#   .\debug-attach.ps1                  # Debug build (best: no inlining, full locals)
#   .\debug-attach.ps1 -Config DirectX  # release builds also work (PDBs exist)
#
# The game window opens normally; play until it crashes. When it does, the
# triage (exception, stack, locals) is appended to crashdumps\cdb_*.log and the
# process exits. For interactive breakpoints/watches, prefer opening
# vc17\NyxosClient.sln in Visual Studio and F5 with the Debug config.
