-- NyxosClient targets a SINGLE protocol/asset era: Tibia 12.40+/15.x (client
-- version 1525, crystalserver/Canary). The old per-version feature ladder
-- (`if version >= 770/780/.../1100/1200/...`) was removed together with
-- legacy-protocol support; what remains is the fixed 1525 feature profile below.
--
-- `version` is still received because updateFeatures is wired to
-- onClientVersionChange, but it only guards the reset (version <= 0) — the enabled
-- set is constant. This list is the cumulative union of every `if version >= N`
-- block up to 1525 from the previous laddered features.lua, MINUS
-- GameMessageSizeCheck: the old code enabled it at >= 841 and then disabled it at
-- >= 1200 (the modern framing has no inner U16 message-size field), so for 1525 it
-- was effectively OFF. resetFeatures() below leaves it off, so it is simply not
-- listed here — do NOT add it back.
